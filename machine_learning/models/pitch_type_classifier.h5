The file `machine_learning/models/pitch_type_classifier.h5` is a binary file that contains the weights of a trained machine learning model. It is not something that can be generated through code as it is the output of a machine learning training process. Typically, this file would be created using a Python script with TensorFlow or Keras, where a neural network is defined, trained on labeled data, and then saved to an `.h5` file.

However, since the task is to generate code, I will provide a Python script that would be used to train a pitch type classifier model and save it as `pitch_type_classifier.h5`. This script would be part of the training process, not the actual `.h5` file itself.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, LSTM
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

# Assuming data_preprocessing.py includes functions to load and preprocess the dataset
from data_preprocessing import load_data, preprocess_data

# Load and preprocess the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data()
X_train, X_test = preprocess_data(X_train, X_test)

# Define the model architecture
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2]), return_sequences=True),
    Dropout(0.5),
    LSTM(64),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(y_train.shape[1], activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Define a model checkpoint to save the best model during training
checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint('models/pitch_type_classifier.h5', monitor='val_loss', verbose=1, save_best_only=True, mode='min')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), callbacks=[checkpoint])

# Save the final model
model.save('models/pitch_type_classifier.h5')
```

Please note that this is a hypothetical example. The actual architecture of the model, the preprocessing steps, and the training process would depend on the specific requirements of the AI Baseball Coach application and the data available for training.
